Help us get going by submitting reviews. Reading papers takes time, but rapid reviews don’t. When you read a preprint, take a few minutes to complete a review here: https://tinyurl.com/osrapid. We’ve tried to make it super easy. The only text answers are if you want to add suggestions for us - we're keen to get your thoughts on how to make this work better.

And spread the word. Tweet and talk about your preprints and your rapid reviews.
