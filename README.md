# Rapid Reviews for [Outbreak Science](http://outbreakscience.org)

Outbreaks demand quick responses informed by evolving evidence. Scientists can now share their research [faster than ever](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549) with preprint manuscripts. This allows rapid, open dissemination of data, code, and results. Yet preprints are not peer reviewed, so finding the most important preprints can be challenging.

We’re trying to make that easier. We're developing open tools for scientists to provide immediate reviews on preprints they read. Rapid reviews can help officials and scientists find important scientific advances faster. And fast, high-quality information can help us all fight outbreaks.

Could this be useful for other fields? Yes. That is one reason we are building open tools. Rapid reviews can help everyone.

**Scientists**

Help us get going by submitting reviews. Reading papers takes time, but rapid reviews don’t. When you read a preprint, take a few minutes to complete a review here: https://tinyurl.com/osrapid. We’ve tried to make it super easy. The only text answers are if you want to add suggestions for us - we're keen to get your thoughts on how to make this work better.

And spread the word. Tweet and talk about your preprints and your rapid reviews.
