# Rapid Reviews [for Outbreak Science]
Welcome to Rapid Reviews, a project for rapid, open reviews of preprint manuscripts related to infectious disease outbreaks.

### Introduction
Preprints (scientific manuscripts shared prior to peer review), are increasingly being embraced as an option for immediate, open dissemination of scientific content in [epidemics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549). Because preprints are open and enable almost immediate publication, they enable rapid communication of evolving science that may be of high importance to public health agencies, scientists, scientific journals, and the media. To maximize the benefits of preprints to all of these stakeholders, it is important to rapidly identify preprints with important, high quality data, code, and results.
